            <h3>Rainbow Six Siege has just entered its seventh year, and kicking things off is the 
                <br>new Demon Veil season. As well as a new Map, new Operator, and the 
                <br>permanent addition of the Team Deathmatch mode, Demon Veil will introduce a 
                <br>new layer of strategy that could have huge ramifications for the rest of the game.<br><br>
                <br>The headline change coming in Demon Veil is its new Operator. Azami is a 2
                <br> Health 2 Speed Defender hailing from Japan. As well as her weaponry - the D-50 
                <br>handgun and your choice of either the 9X19SVN submachine gun or the ACS12 
                <br>shotgun - her gadget is the Kiba Barrier. Throwing one of her five special Kunai 
                <br>allows her to create destructible barriers around the map, forcing attackers 
                <br>down certain routes or plugging up holes to protect from drones and grenades. 
                <br>Elsewhere, another Defender, Goyo, is getting a slight adjustment, and will now 
                <br>be able to place his gas canisters on walls as well as floors.
                <br><br>
                Demon Veil also brings in a new Map - Emerald Plains. Based around a manor 
                <br>house in the emerald island of Ireland, you'll be fighting on multiple levels, from 
                <br>perfectly-manicured gardens right up to the rooftop. Emerald Plains is the first 
                <br>new Rainbow Six Siege map in three years, so it's going to be an exciting new 
                <br>battleground to play through.
